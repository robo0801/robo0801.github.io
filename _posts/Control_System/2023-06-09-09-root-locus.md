# 09 제어공학 root locus techniques

## Define
Root Locus: A graphical representation of closed loop poles as system parameter varies
![define](/assets/images/Control_System_img/9-1-define.jpg)

## Root Locus - Basic Rule
#### 1. Number of branches
The number of branches of root locus equals the number of closed loop poles  
num of branches = num of poles  

#### 2. Symmetry
The root locus is symmerty about the real axis  
전달함수 분포: 실계수 함수 -> root: complex conjugate  

#### 3. Real-axis segments
On the real axis for $k>0$ , the root locus exists to the left of an odd number of real finite open loop poles and/or zeros.

#### 4. Starting and ending points
The root locus begins at the finite and infinite poles of $G(s)R(s)$ and ends at the finite and infinite zeros of $G(s)R(s)$

#### 5. Behavior at infinity
무한대에서 방향
The root locus approaches straight lines as asymptotes as the locus approches infinity.  
Further, the equations of the asymptotes are given by the real axis intercept and angle in radians as follows.

## Root Locus - Additional Rule
#### 1. Real-axis break away and break in points
The root locus break away from the real axis at a point where the gain is maximum and break into the real axis at a point where the gain is minimum.

#### 2. Calculation of jw-axis crossings
The root locus acrosses the jw-axis at the point where $\angle G(s)H(s)=(2k+1)\pi$   
Routh-Hurwiz or a search of the jw-axis for $(2k+1)\pi$ can be used to find the jw-axis crossings.
